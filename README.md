# Project: Sudoku

# This program is an implementation of a 9x9 sudoku puzzle in assembly language. When the program starts, the cursor is at the top of the board. As the user enters numbers or presses space, the cursor moves around the board, filling or skipping the slots. After the cursor has cycled through the board, the user is given the option of either trying again, in which the cursor is at the top of the board and ready to cycle again, or seeing the solution and quitting.

# This project was written using 16 bit x86 assembly language. It is MASM/TASM compatible and fits a 80x25 screen size.
